Troubleshooting:

~Make sure your input files for enemies matches the format of forestOrc.txt (or for potions healthPotion.txt)

~If there's whitespace after your last line then the read-in wont work. Make sure the last line with input
 has nothing after it
   ex:
   	  some_value: that_Value
   	  -VALID WHITESPACE HERE-
   	  another_vale: this_value
   	  -VALID WHITESPACE HERE-
      last_value: myValue
      -INVALID WHITESPACE, YOU SHOULDNT BE ABLE TO CLICK HERE- 
      
~Make sure the .txt file is located in src folder not the package it's used in. Should be right below 
 "JRE System Library" in eclipse's Project Explorer tab.
